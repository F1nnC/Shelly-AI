# Shelly Surf AI 🐚
- Going to be a chat-based surf guide
- Can ask it where to go, and can interpret based on conditions
- For example, if I was a beginner I could have it tell me the location best for beginners near me
- Or have it tell me the spot that will most likely have barrels near me

# Why I wanted to create the project
- One I really like surfing
- Two I wanna flex that I made an AI for job and personal
- Three eliminate looking at surfline and not knowing what all the numbers mean

# How to run it
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
