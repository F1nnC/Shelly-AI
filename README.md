# Shelly Surf AI 🐚
- Going to be a chat-based surf guide
- Can ask it where to go, and can interpret based on conditions
- For example, if I was a beginner I could have it tell me the location best for beginners near me
- Or have it tell me the spot that will most likely have barrels near me

# Why I wanted to create the project
- One I really like surfing
- Two I wanna flex that I made an AI for job and personal
- Three eliminate looking at surfline and not knowing what all the numbers mean

---

# How to run it locally
1. Download Docker 🐋
2. Run this in the terminal `docker-compose up --build`
  - This step may take a while because it has to download the lite version of the AI
3. Access the website at this link `http://127.0.0.1:8012`
